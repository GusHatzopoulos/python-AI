# Python AI Engineering Practice

A structured Python-based AI engineering repository dedicated to hands-on experimentation, data pipeline architecture, machine learning model development, and reproducible workflow implementation.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as a structured training environment for developing strong AI engineering foundations using Python.

The objective is to move beyond theoretical learning and focus on:

- Practical implementation of AI concepts
- Clean, modular, and scalable Python code
- Reproducible machine learning workflows
- Data-driven experimentation
- Analytical and engineering discipline

This repository is designed as a long-term skill-building environment rather than a collection of isolated scripts.
